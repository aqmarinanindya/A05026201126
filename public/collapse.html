                  <strong>Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14 inches (20–36 cm) high </strong>
                  They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat. The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the hindquarters, though the transition does limit overflow.

                  <strong>Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful.</strong> 
                  They can be aggressive with other dogs and humans to try to prove themselves.[9][10] Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

                  <strong>The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years.</strong> 
                  A well-bred dog on a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; if kept trim and fit, the Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many other dog breeds, although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's lightweight build. Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and teeth-, ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per litter.
